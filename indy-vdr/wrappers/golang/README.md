# Run demo

- The Go demo requires libindy_vdr shared library to be installed (eg: /usr/local/lib), and the header file `include/libindy_vdr.h`
to be installed in your C include path (eg: /usr/local/include).  You can run sample code using Indy VDR using command:
```
go run cmd/demo/demo.go
```

- This demo is by default a read only connection to Sovrin Buildernet network.  To test writes, you
can connect to different ledger by specifying path to genesis file and a seed for ed25519 keys that have ENDORSER or STEWARD role
on that ledger.
```
go run cmd/demo/demo.go ~/.indy_client/pool/local/local.txn "b2352b32947e188eb72871093ac6217e"
```

- To enable indy_vdr library logs, specify `RUST_LOG` environment variable with
desired logging level. Example:
```
RUST_LOG=trace go run cmd/demo/demo.go
```

# Requirements
- Golang >= `1.14.4` and CGO enabled.
